# RAID xv6 Extension

A robust RAID implementation built on the xv6 operating system, providing advanced storage reliability and performance features for RISC-V architecture. 

## ⭐ Features

### RAID Level Support
- **RAID 0**: Striping for enhanced performance through parallel data distribution
- **RAID 1**:  Mirroring for complete data redundancy
- **RAID 4**: Block-level striping with dedicated parity disk
- **RAID 5**: Distributed parity for balanced performance and redundancy
- **RAID 01**:  Nested RAID combining striping and mirroring for optimal performance and reliability

### Concurrent Disk Access
- Thread-safe disk operations with proper synchronization
- Support for multiple simultaneous read/write requests
- Lock-based concurrency control for data integrity
- Minimized lock contention through fine-grained locking strategies

### Error Detection and Recovery
- Comprehensive error detection mechanisms
- Automatic data recovery using parity information (RAID 4, 5)
- Checksum validation for data integrity verification
- Seamless failover to redundant copies when available

### Disk Failure Simulation and Repair
- Simulated disk failure scenarios for testing resilience
- Hot-swap capability for failed disk replacement
- Complete data restoration from parity and redundant copies


## 🛠️ Getting Started

This project requires a RISC-V cross-compiler and the QEMU emulator. 

### 1. Installing Toolchain
- **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf qemu-system-misc`
- **macOS:** `brew install riscv-gnu-toolchain qemu`

### 2. Building and Running

```bash
# Clean the project (optional)
make clean

# Build and run in QEMU emulator
make qemu
```

The `make qemu` command will build the kernel with RAID support and launch it in the QEMU emulator. 

### 3. Running Your Programs

To run your own programs and experiment with RAID features:

1. Open `user/javni_test.c`
2. Modify the `main` to include your code
3. Rebuild with `make qemu`
4. When the xv6 shell prompt appears, type `javni_test` and press Enter

```bash
$ javni_test
# Your RAID tests will execute
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

The implementation includes comprehensive testing for:

- **Striping correctness**: Verify data distribution across disks
- **Mirror synchronization**: Ensure data consistency between mirrored disks
- **Parity integrity**: Validate parity calculations and storage
- **Concurrent operations**: Test race conditions and deadlock prevention
- **Single disk failure**: Test degraded mode operation
- **Multiple disk failures**: Test failure threshold limits (RAID-dependent)
- **Data consistency**: Verify no data corruption during failures
